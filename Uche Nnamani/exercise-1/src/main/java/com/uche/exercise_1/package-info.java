/**
 *  This package contains a utility class for calculating the Collatz Function. It contains 3 public methods as follows:
 *   - calculateCollatzSeriesUsingForLoop(int n)
 *        + This is a solution using traditional java for loop.
 *
 *   - calculateCollatzSeriesUsingRecursion(int n)
 *        + This is a solution using head recursion. *
 *
 *   - calculateCollatzSeriesUsingTailRecursion(int n)
 *        + This is a solution using tail recursion.
 *        - No need using a helper method to achieve tail recursion as it was possible to do so with single method.
 *
 *
 *   Unit tests, for each method, have been provided in the following folder:
 *    src/test/java/com/uche/exercise_1
